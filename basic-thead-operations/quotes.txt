"The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should therefore be regarded as a criminal offense." E.W. Dijkstra

"FORTRAN is not a flower but a weed — it is hardy, occasionally blooms, and grows in every computer." Alan J. Perlis.
"For a long time it puzzled me how something so expensive, so leading edge, could be so useless. And then it occurred to me that a computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things. They are, in short, a perfect match.” Bill Bryson
"In My Egotistical Opinion, most people's C programs should be indented six feet downward and covered with dirt." Blair P. Houghton.
"When someone says: 'I want a programming language in which I need only say what I wish done', give him a lollipop." Alan J. Perlis
